# Adding Categories to Your Project

This guide explains how to add categories to your AI Kickstart project by including them in your README.md file.

## Where to Add Categories

Add a "Categories" section to your README.md file, typically near the end of the document. The section should look like this:

```markdown
## Categories

This project falls into the following categories:

- AI
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- OpenShift
- Model Training
```

## Standard Categories

Use these standard categories when possible:

### AI/ML Categories
- AI
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Deep Learning
- Data Science

### Technology Categories
- OpenShift
- Kubernetes
- Python
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter

### Application Types
- REST API
- Web Application
- CLI Tool

### Process Categories
- Data Processing
- Model Training
- Model Serving
- Model Deployment

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Choose categories that accurately describe your project
2. **Don't Overcategorize**: Use 3-5 categories that best represent your project
3. **Use Standard Categories**: Stick to the standard categories when possible
4. **Keep Updated**: Update categories when your project changes
5. **Use Tags for Specifics**: Use the Tags section for more specific identifiers

## Example

Here's an example of a well-categorized project:

```markdown
## Categories

This project falls into the following categories:

- AI
- Computer Vision
- TensorFlow
- OpenShift
- Model Training

## Tags

- image-classification
- transfer-learning
- resnet
- python-3.8
```

## How Categories Are Used

1. Categories are automatically extracted from your README.md file
2. They are combined with GitHub topics and language for better discoverability
3. They appear in the project card on the AI Kickstarts website
4. They can be used to filter and search for projects
